## What is Tasty Tracks?
I'm glad you asked. Tasty Tracks is a mobile app using data from Spotify to create a realtime game experience around music trends.

Built with **Flutter** and **Firebase** as an independent research project with [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io/).

## How does it work?
Tasty Tracks works like this:
1. **Place a bet.** Invest some points in a track you think will increase in popularity.
1. **Let it ride.** Hang out for a while.
1. **Cash out.** At any point you can cash out your bet for more (or less) points based on the change in popularity score.
